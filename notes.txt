Features
* photo gallery instead of newspaper articles
* user has folders (with images unsorted within them)
  * image's folder can be chosen at upload time
  * folder can changed through edit dialog
    * or drag-and-drop between folders if I feel ambitious
* undo feature - queue up deletion while notification lasts, cancel if Undo clicked, actually delete when notification expires
* when connectivity lost, fall back to read-only mode (able to see metadata and album organization, no editing or viewing images)

Implementation
* Colors: green is #006600, purple is #660066 (if I still want to use that scheme, maybe not, maybe pick a new one with material palette thingy)

* Rust stuff
  * may be able to get rid of wasm.rs, trim nif.rs down to rustler::init! call; use cfg_attr to apply wasm_bindgen, rustler_nif to struct in logic.rs
    * https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/conditional-compilation.html#the-cfg_attr-attribute
  * add datetime support to picture metadata
    * https://docs.rs/kamadak-exif/0.5.4/exif/struct.DateTime.html
    * https://docs.rs/chrono/0.4.19/chrono/
  * test with pics from my phone, see what EXIF fields photos have by default
